**Low cost, binary watch based off the PIC16F527 MCU for promotional purposes at MacroFab, INC.**

This repository contains all the documentation and instructions needed to build a Macro_Watch. The Macro_Watch is a binary style watch based off the PIC16F527. It is designed to be low cost and easy to manufacture. The watch runs off of a single CR2032. The PIC16F527 is running in "LP" (Low Power Crystal Mode) which has an average power draw of ~16uA @ the 3.0V the watch runs at. The crystal is a 32.768kHz which allows for a clean conversion to a 1Hz signal for timekeeping.
